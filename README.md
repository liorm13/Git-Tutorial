# RAEDME and md format

* this file was created online on github.

md stands for markdown which is a way to format the text, lets see a few examples:
* by using '#' before the text it made it a title text.
* by using '*' we aded a big dot like the ones used in these lines.

the name of the file can be changed below the text editor online under commit new file.
in this case the defualt will be "Create README.md" for the first time creating the file.
after editing the file once the defualt will be "Update README.md".

the commits tab will show us all the commits we have made so far.
when we enter these commits it shows us with green line and a '+' sign what lines were added,
and with a red line and '-' sign which line was removed. 
edited lines will show as deleted original line and then added edited line.
